## Crop Tool (<kbd>C</kbd>)

The _Crop_ tool acts similarly to the [Selection tool](command:walkthroughs.selectStep?%22luna.selectionTools%22), but it will crop as soon as the selection is made.

> ℹ️ For more precision, cropping can also be performed with a regular selection (<kbd>ctrl/cmd+shift+x</kbd>) or with the action in the top bar when selection tools are active.
